# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview Project

Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images.To do this, we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. 

## Results:

Images of the Mission to Mars Website are below. The website was created through the index.html file to run app.py and scraping.py which scraped through all the websites above to retrieve the information. The Mission to Mars Website shows the latest Mars news article title and subtitle, the latest featured Mars image, Mars Facts, and images of Mars' Hemispheres. There is also a button available to scrape new data. The website was customized using Bootstrap.


The components of the deliverables are as follows
